Title: Mindful Monitor - Real-Time Inappropriate Content Detection

Abstract: Mindful Monitor is a software solution that addresses the challenge of inappropriate content found online, which can be harmful, especially for children or vulnerable individuals. This abstract presents a real-time monitoring tool that continuously monitors desktop screens using Google Vision and Python libraries to detect and alert users when any obscene or inappropriate content is detected. The software can be used in educational institutions, homes, or any other environment where responsible technology use is a priority. By detecting inappropriate content, the software aims to promote safer and more responsible technology usage while providing peace of mind to users and guardians.
Introduction: With the increasing use of technology, there is a growing concern about inappropriate content that individuals, especially children, may encounter while using computers or devices. The Mindful Monitor software is developed to tackle this challenge by offering continuous desktop screen monitoring for obscene or inappropriate content. Using the power of Google Vision and Python, the software provides real-time alerts to users when it detects such content.

Key Features:

•	Continuous Screen Monitoring: The software monitors the desktop screen continuously to identify any inappropriate content that may appear.
•	Google Vision Integration: The software integrates with Google Vision, a machine learning platform, to analyze images and videos for inappropriate content detection.
•	Pytesseract for Text Analysis: The software uses the Pytesseract library to analyze text content in images for profanity detection.
•	Better Profanity Library: The Better Profanity library helps identify profane words and assess the level of profanity in the text content.
•	Real-Time Alerts: When inappropriate content is detected, the software provides real-time alerts to users, warning them about the content's nature.
•	Safe Content Identification: The software classifies content as safe, risky, or strictly prohibited based on the likelihood of inappropriate content detected by Google Vision and the level of profanity in the text.
•	Reporting: The software generates a report for each monitoring session, including the date and time of monitoring, and the classification of the content detected.

Requirements:

•	Google Cloud Vision API credentials are required for integration with Google Vision.
•	Tesseract OCR needs to be installed, and the path to the executable should be provided.
•	The Better Profanity library should be installed to analyze text content.

Usage:

•	Execute the script to start the monitoring process.
•	The software will continuously capture the desktop screen and analyze the content.
•	Real-time alerts will be displayed to the user if any inappropriate or profane content is detected.
•	The software generates a report ('report.txt') after each monitoring session, providing details of the session and the classification of content.

Conclusion: 

The Mindful Monitor software is an essential tool for promoting responsible technology usage and safeguarding users from inappropriate content. By integrating Google Vision and Python libraries, the software provides real-time monitoring and alerts, enhancing the safety and security of individuals, especially students. The software's ability to identify and classify content allows for a more informed approach to technology usage, ensuring a safer online environment. Mindful Monitor has the potential to make a positive impact by fostering responsible technology use in educational institutions, homes, and other settings.
